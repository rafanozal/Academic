In order to employ their full potential, appropriate description means for web services need to be developed. For this purpose, we define a fully-fledged Web Service Modeling Framework (WSMF) that provides the appropriate conceptual model for developing and describing web services and their composition (complex web services). In a nutshell, its philosophy is based on the following principle: maximal de-coupling complemented by a scalable mediation service ."

In spite of this, most everyday sequence manipulation tools are distributed across several programs and web servers, sometimes requiring installation and typically involving frequent switching between applications. To address this problem, here we have developed BioWord, a macro-enabled self-installing template for Microsoft Word documents that integrates an extensive suite of DNA and protein sequence manipulation tools.",
